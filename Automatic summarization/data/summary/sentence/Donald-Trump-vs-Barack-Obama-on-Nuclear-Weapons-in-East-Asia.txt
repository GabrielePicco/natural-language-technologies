Donald Trump vs Barack Obama on Nuclear Weapons in East Asia

Donald Trump broke a lot of foreign-policy crockery last week.
(So far, my favorite scholarly comment has been: “There is no indication that Trump understands the workings of balance of power theory…” Of course, there is no indication that Mr. Trump cares about the workings of any theories—and no real danger that he subscribes to them.)
Mr. Trump suggested that, if South Korea and Japan had nuclear weapons, we could spend less protecting those allies.
Yet Mr. Trump has—okay, maybe unwittingly—highlighted a question about the entire non-proliferation enterprise that is at least as important as anything that happened at Mr. Obama’s summit.
Mr. Trump is right about one thing: The big question raised by North Korea’s success in building a nuclear arsenal is whether South Korea and Japan feel obliged to follow suit.
Whatever he understands about the workings of balance-of-power theory, Donald Trump has provided one such reminder.

The Last Man on the Moon: Eugene Cernan gives a compelling account

I walked on the moon.
What can’t you do?” These are the final words spoken by Eugene (Gene) Cernan in the documentary film The Last Man on the Moon.
The film gives a personal, compelling account of some of the main events in Cernan’s life as an astronaut, especially his involvement in the Apollo programme.
But the film is much more than a biography of Cernan; it is his account of one of the most important parts of the history of human spaceflight.
The original crew of Gemini 9 were killed in a plane crash, moving Cernan from backup astronaut to flight crew.
Overheating from his exertions, combined with heat from the Sun, made him sweat – causing his helmet to fog upwhen the temperatured fell, which was once every 90 minutes as the capsule orbited Earth.
Cernan speaks with emotion of the accident that took the lives of three of his friends and colleagues, and the effect it had on the remaining astronauts.
His first Apollo flight was as a member of the Apollo 10 crew, which went to the Moon, to simulate landing and docking.
He was clearly moved by the experience, speaking evocatively of seeing the Earth rise for the first time.
Cernan’s first wife is an important part of the documentary, describing what it was like living in the “astronaut colony”.
As Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, took “one small step” to make “a giant leap for mankind”, so Cernan marked his departure from the moon with “man’s last step from the surface”, hoping that “we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind”.
The documentary once again reminds us of the gift the bravery of the Apollo astronauts gave us – a heritage of human spaceflight that has now enabled a much more global and co-operative space programme.

People Aren't Upgrading Smartphones as Quickly and That Is Bad for Apple

The brokerage on Wednesday cut its 2016 and 2017 fiscal year estimates for iPhone sales, citing longer upgrade cycles.
The move also caused it to lower its earnings projections for this year and next, and it led it to slice its price target on shares to $130 from $141, 19% above where the stock recently traded at $109.22.
Part of the decline may have been driven by a slowdown ahead of Samsungâ€™s Galaxy S7 launch in March and growth of iPhone sales in Apple stores, which operators might not be factoring into their upgrade rates, he said.
Sales of iPhone units should now hit 210 million in the current fiscal year and 220 million in fiscal 2017, he estimates.
Even though data from phone carriers suggests the upgrade cycle is being extended, it will take a few more quarters and the launch of the next iPhone to confirm whether users are indeed keeping their outdated phones for longer, said Mr. Piecyk.

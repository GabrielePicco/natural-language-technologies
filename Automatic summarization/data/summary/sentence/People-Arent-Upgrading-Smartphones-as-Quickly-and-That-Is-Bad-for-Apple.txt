People Aren't Upgrading Smartphones as Quickly and That Is Bad for Apple

The brokerage on Wednesday cut its 2016 and 2017 fiscal year estimates for iPhone sales, citing longer upgrade cycles.
The move also caused it to lower its earnings projections for this year and next, and it led it to slice its price target on shares to $130 from $141, 19% above where the stock recently traded at $109.22.
It’s no new news that iPhone sales are set to decline this fiscal year for the first time in the tech giant’s history.
However, the decline this year has been steeper than prior cycles, said Mr. Piecyk.
Sales of iPhone units should now hit 210 million in the current fiscal year and 220 million in fiscal 2017, he estimates.
